# Programming 3 Course Project: Pirkanmaan Valloitus

Pirkanmaan Valloitus is a turn-based strategy game where you must expand your newfound empire and ultimately build the colossal Victory Monument building to win the game.
To achieve this goal, players must build buildings and train workers, making the most of the natural resources available in their starting region. 
The game can be played alone but multiplayer matches of up to 4 players can also be played. In multiplayer, the first player to build the Victory Monument wins.

This repository contains all the files related to our course project. Further information is available in the Documentation folder.

If you have trouble running the game, please check the Troubleshooting section in the documentation.
